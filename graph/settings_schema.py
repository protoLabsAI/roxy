"""Settings schema — the single source of truth for the operator console's
generic Settings UI.

Each :class:`Field` maps a YAML path (``key``, e.g. ``compaction.enabled``) to
the ``LangGraphConfig`` attribute that holds its live value (``attr``), plus the
metadata the UI needs to render an input and tell the user whether a change
applies on save (hot-reload) or needs a process ``restart``.

The write path reuses ``_apply_settings_changes`` (validate → persist → reload),
so this module only has to: describe fields, read current values, and turn the
flat ``{key: value}`` payload the UI sends back into the nested dict the YAML
writer expects.
