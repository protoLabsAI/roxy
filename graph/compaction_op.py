"""On-demand conversation compaction — the ``/compact`` operator gesture (#1527).

This is the *manual*, whole-thread analogue of the automatic
``SummarizationMiddleware`` (``graph/middleware/compaction.py``): instead of
waiting for the context window to fill, an operator asks for a compaction now.
The live LangGraph checkpoint is the agent's *real* context, so a client-only
compaction would do nothing — this runs SERVER-SIDE against the checkpointer.

The pass, for one thread:

1. ``aget_state`` the current messages off the checkpoint.
2. Render the **full** transcript and archive it into the searchable knowledge
   store (``domain="conversation"``, ``namespace="chat-archive:<session_id>"``)
   so nothing is lost — the raw history stays recallable via ``memory_recall``.
3. Summarize the conversation with the cheap aux model.
4. Rewrite the checkpoint to ``[RemoveMessage(REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES), summary,
   *recent_tail]`` via ``aupdate_state`` — so the next turn carries the whole
   thread's context at a fraction of the token cost.

**Never-lossy (hard invariant).** Compaction must never drop history it could
not archive. If there is no knowledge store, or the archive write yields no
chunks, or the summarizer produces nothing, we DO NOT touch the checkpoint and
return ``refused=True`` — the operator keeps their full, intact context.

**Message-boundary integrity (hard invariant).** The recent tail must never
orphan a ``ToolMessage`` from the ``AIMessage(tool_calls=…)`` that spawned it —
the next model call errors ("tool_call without response"). We reuse the same
safe-cut the auto-summarizer uses: if the naive cutoff lands on a
``ToolMessage``, walk back to include its parent ``AIMessage`` (so the pair is
kept together), summarizing slightly more rather than splitting a pair.

Host-free and unit-testable: it takes the graph, checkpointer, knowledge store,
and config as arguments (no ``STATE`` import), mirroring
``conversation_harvest.harvest_thread``.
