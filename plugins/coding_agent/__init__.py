"""ACP coding-agent client library — the shared plumbing behind ``delegate_to``.

Drives a CLI coding agent (protoCLI ``proto``, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) over
the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over the child's stdio) via
``acp_client.AcpClient``.

This module is **no longer a plugin** — the ``code_with`` tool it used to contribute
was retired in favour of ``delegate_to`` with an ``acp`` delegate (ADR 0025), which
does the same job over one tool alongside a2a/openai delegates and a console panel.
What remains is the ACP client library that the ``delegates`` plugin and the ACP
runtime (ADR 0033) import:

- ``_client_for(spec)`` — get-or-create a cached ``AcpClient`` for a launch+policy
  signature (the cache key includes ``workdir``).
- ``evict_client(spec)`` — pop that cached client AND terminate its subprocess.
- ``_make_permission(spec)`` — the by-kind permission resolver (ADR 0024).

The ``spec`` dict is supplied by the caller; ``permissions`` is the by-kind policy
the client applies to the coding agent's ``session/request_permission`` requests:
``auto`` (allow all), ``allowlist`` (allow all but deny ``execute``/``delete``), or
``readonly`` (allow only read-like kinds) — overridable with ``allow_kinds`` /
``deny_kinds``.
