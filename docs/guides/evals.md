# Eval your fork

The template ships an eval harness under `evals/` so a fresh fork has
a working test suite for its tools, memory, and A2A protocol surface
on day one. Cases assert across three independent channels — audit
log, reply text, and knowledge-store side effects — so a model that
hallucinates a tool result still gets caught.

## When to read this

- You forked the template and want a baseline pass-rate before you
  ship.
- You added a new tool and want to lock in its intent — "when the
  operator says X, fire tool Y".
- You changed a prompt or model and want to measure regression.

## Run the suite

```bash
# Agent running at $EVAL_BASE_URL (default http://localhost:7870)
# with the relevant auth env (A2A_AUTH_TOKEN and/or <AGENT>_API_KEY).

python -m evals.runner
python -m evals.runner --category tool
python -m evals.runner --tasks current_time_intent,daily_log_intent
```

Reports land in `evals/results/run-<ts>.json` (gitignored — they're run
artifacts, not source). The CLI prints a pass/fail board; the JSON report
carries reply previews, timing, and the **model under test** (auto-detected from
`/healthz`, overridable with `--model-label`) so runs stay comparable.

## Compare models, track over time

Improving an agent means measuring it the same way every time and being able to
swap the model and compare ([ADR 0012](/adr/0012-eval-strategy-and-model-comparison)).

**Swap one model:** `PROTOAGENT_MODEL` wins over the YAML `model.name`, so you
can point the same agent at a different model without editing config:

```bash
PROTOAGENT_MODEL=vendor/some-model python server.py --ui none
```

**Sweep several models** with one command — `evals/sweep.py` boots a throwaway,
UI-less agent per model (its own port + `PROTOAGENT_INSTANCE`, so they never
share data), runs the suite tagged with each model, tears each down, and prints a
`model × category` matrix:

```bash
python -m evals.sweep --models protolabs/reasoning,protolabs/smart
python -m evals.sweep --models a,b,c --category tool      # one category
python -m evals.sweep --models a,b --tasks current_time_intent --keep
```

```
| Model                 | a2a-protocol | tool        | **Overall**     |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `protolabs/reasoning` | 3/3 (100%)   | 6/6 (100%)  | **9/9 (100%)**  |
| `protolabs/smart`     | 3/3 (100%)   | 4/6 (67%)   | **7/9 (78%)**   |
```

**Best-of-N for noisy cases** — tool selection and other non-deterministic
behavior varies run to run, so a single sweep can mislead. `--repeat N` runs the
suite N times per model (against the same booted agent, isolating model-sampling
variance from boot variance) and prints a per-case `passes/N` table, scoring each
model on the cases that passed the **majority** of runs:

```bash
python -m evals.sweep --models protolabs/reasoning,protolabs/smart,protolabs/fast \
  --category tool --repeat 3
```

```
| Case            | smart | reasoning | fast  |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|-------|
| `calculator`    | 3/3   | 3/3       | 0/3 ✗ |
| `fetch_url`     | 3/3   | 3/3       | 0/3 ✗ |
| `web_search`    | 3/3   | 3/3       | 2/3   |
| **Best-of-N**   | 9/9   | 9/9       | 5/9   |
```

A `✗` marks a case that failed the majority of runs — e.g. a fast model that
consistently answers inline instead of *calling* the tool (a structural gap),
versus a one-off flake that still clears the majority.

**Track the trend** across every run on the box — `evals/report.py` aggregates
the model-tagged reports into a leaderboard (latest standing per model, best
first) plus a per-model trend (pass rate by run, ▲/▼ vs the last one):

```bash
python -m evals.report                          # all models
python -m evals.report --model protolabs/reasoning
```

For a single before/after of one change, `evals/compare.py` diffs two reports
(pass-rate delta, per-category, which cases flipped):

```bash
python -m evals.compare evals/results/run-OLD.json evals/results/run-NEW.json
```

## The three assertion channels

```
prompt → A2A → audit log         (1) tools fired with expected outcome
            → reply text         (2) substrings present in reply
            → KB chunks table    (3) side effects landed correctly
```

A case passes only when every configured assertion holds. Most cases
should opt in to channels 1 and 3 — text patterns alone are brittle
to model paraphrasing and miss hallucinated tool results entirely.

### Why side-effect verification beats text-only

A model can produce "Logged: ..." in its reply without actually
calling `daily_log`. Substring matching passes, the DB stays empty,
and the bug ships. Reading `audit.jsonl` and the `chunks` table
afterward catches it.

## The shape of a case

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "category": "tool",
  "kind": "ask",
  "name": "Asks for arithmetic → calculator",
  "prompt": "How much is 17 times 23, plus 1?",
  "expected_tools": ["calculator"],
  "expected_patterns": ["392"],
  "verify_kb": {
    "find_chunk_containing": "EVAL-MARK-XYZ",
    "domain": "context"
  },
  "setup":    [{"kb_ingest": {"content": "...", "domain": "...", "heading": "..."}}],
  "teardown": [{"kb_delete_by_content": {"contains": "..."}}]
}
```

The case `kind`s that ship:

- `agent_card` — fetch `/.well-known/agent-card.json` and assert on
  the card's name, skill count, and declared extensions.
- `auth_check` — send a request with a deliberately bad bearer and
  assert the server returns the expected status (401 by default).
- `ask` — the main shape. Sends `prompt`, then asserts on tool firing,
  reply patterns, and KB state.
- `stream` — like `ask` over SSE, plus asserts the stream surfaced the
  expected event kinds.
- `goal` — set a goal, trigger the loop, assert the resulting goal state.
- `workflow` — drive a recipe end-to-end via `POST /api/workflows/{name}/run`
  and assert on its synthesized output (patterns + rubric). Used to track the
  subagent workflows (research-and-brief, deep-research).

## Asserting the agent layer (subagents & workflows)

Beyond single-tool selection, the suite tracks the layers recent work has been
about ([ADR 0012](/adr/0012-eval-strategy-and-model-comparison)):

**Delegation** — for intent that's satisfied equally by several tools (the lead
might delegate open-ended research via a `task` subagent *or* a `run_workflow`
recipe), assert that *any* of them fired rather than over-constraining to one:

```json
{ "kind": "ask", "category": "subagent",
  "prompt": "Go research X properly and report back.",
  "expected_any_tools": ["task", "task_batch", "run_workflow"] }
```

**Workflows** — a `workflow` case runs a recipe and asserts on the output:

```json
{ "kind": "workflow", "category": "workflow", "workflow": "deep-research",
  "inputs": {"topic": "…", "depth": "standard"},
  "expected_patterns": ["counterpoint"],
  "verify_rubric": { "criteria": ["…"], "threshold": 0.75 },
  "timeout_s": 420 }
```

## Grading quality substrings can't — the LLM judge

"Is the deep-research report *actually balanced*? Is the confidence *earned*?"
can't be checked with a substring. Add a `verify_rubric` to any `ask` /
`workflow` case: a grader model scores the output against independent yes/no
criteria and the case passes when the fraction met clears `threshold`.

```json
"verify_rubric": {
  "criteria": [
    "Presents opposing/critical perspectives, not just the consensus",
    "Has a counterpoints or caveats section that engages the opposition",
    "States a confidence level that is justified, not merely asserted"
  ],
  "threshold": 0.66,
  "model": "protolabs/reasoning"
}
```

The grader reuses the gateway via `graph.llm.create_llm`; it defaults to
`$EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL` then the agent's model. It's non-deterministic and costs
tokens — treat rubric scores as a **tracked signal** (trend across models), with
the deterministic channels (audit / substring / KB) as the hard pass/fail. A
grader error never crashes the run (the case just fails with the reason).

## Prompt rule

**The tool name never appears in the prompt.** Every prompt must be
plausibly typed by a real user. "Use `daily_log` to record..." tests
instruction-following, not tool selection. If the agent needs to
infer the tool from intent, that *is* the test.

## Setup and teardown — start clean every time

Each `ask` case can pre-seed state via `setup` blocks (BFCL's
`initial_config` pattern: direct DB writes the model never sees) and
clean up after itself with `teardown`. The fixture is invisible to
the agent — it discovers the seeded state via tools, exactly as a
real user would.

`teardown` runs even when assertions fail, so case order doesn't
matter and a noisy failure doesn't poison the next run.

Supported setup/teardown step kinds (extend `evals/verify.py` to add
more):

| Step kind | Args | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `kb_ingest` | `content`, `domain`, `heading?` | Insert a chunk |
| `kb_delete_by_content` | `contains` | Delete chunks where content LIKE `%contains%` |
| `kb_delete_by_heading` | `domain`, `heading` | Delete chunks matching (domain, heading) |

## What forks should test by default

The starter `tasks.json` covers:

- Agent card discovery (name, skill count, `cost-v1` extension)
- Bearer auth gating
- Each shipped tool fires from a plausible operator prompt
- Memory ingest → recall round-trip
- KB-driven middleware injection (no tool call needed)
- A chained two-tool case (`daily_log` then `memory_recall`)

When you add a tool, add at least one case for it. When you add a
skill to the agent card, extend the `card_discovery` case to assert
the new skill is advertised.

## Running in CI

The runner exits non-zero when any case fails, so it drops in cleanly:

```yaml
- name: Boot agent
  run: docker compose up -d agent

- name: Wait for /health
  run: ./scripts/wait-for-it.sh http://localhost:7870/.well-known/agent-card.json

- name: Run evals
  run: python -m evals.runner
  env:
    EVAL_BASE_URL: http://localhost:7870
    A2A_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AGENT_BEARER }}
```

For non-deterministic categories (any `tool` or `chained` case), aim
for an N-of-M majority threshold rather than 100% — the reference
implementation runs 3 attempts and gates at 2 passes for those
categories. Deterministic ones (`a2a-protocol`, `subsystem` with
seeded state) gate at 100%.

## Testing push notifications

A2A push notifications POST to a consumer callback URL. To assert on delivery without a real server, use [`evals/webhook.py`](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoAgent/blob/main/evals/webhook.py):

```python
from evals.webhook import webhook_listener

async with webhook_listener() as (url, capture):
    # register `url` as the task's pushNotificationConfig, then run the task
    ...
    assert capture.received  # the agent delivered a notification (body + headers captured)
```

It runs a raw `asyncio` HTTP server on an ephemeral port (no FastAPI/aiohttp) and captures each POST body + headers.
