"""Reverse proxy for the fleet console (ADR 0042 slug routing).

The hub forwards console traffic to a specific agent named by the **URL slug** —
``/agents/<slug>/<path>`` (the slug lives in the console URL ``/app/agent/<slug>/``), so each
console window targets its own agent independently (chat → ``/agents/<slug>/api/chat``, SSE →
``/agents/<slug>/api/events``, A2A → ``/agents/<slug>/a2a``). ``slug == "host"`` is this
instance; any other slug resolves to its workspace port via the supervisor. There is no
server-side "active" pointer — switching agents is just navigating the console URL, so two
windows can't desync (the URL is the source of truth). The slug only resolves while that
agent is actually running.

Streaming-safe: responses (incl. SSE) are piped through unbuffered, and the upstream
client is closed when the stream ends.
