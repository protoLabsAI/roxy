"""Drift guard for the config triplet (refactor: config single source of truth).

Three structures must stay in lock-step:

* ``graph.settings_schema.FIELDS`` — the operator console's settings registry,
  mapping each dotted YAML ``key`` to the ``LangGraphConfig`` ``attr`` that holds
  its live value plus its UI ``type``.
* ``graph.config.LangGraphConfig`` — the live dataclass the runtime reads.
* ``graph.config_io.config_to_dict`` — the nested-dict serializer the UI round-
  trips through.

When these drift apart the failure is silent in production: the Settings UI
shows a field that never persists (missing dataclass attr), or a save round-trips
through a serializer that drops the section on the floor. These tests turn any
such drift into a CI failure.

Test #5 (2026-06-10) guards the third direction: ``LangGraphConfig.from_dict``
must CONSUME every FIELDS key — a missing parse line means the YAML holds the
value, config_to_dict shows it "saved", but the runtime silently reads the
default.

NOTE on the import path: ``config_to_dict`` lives in ``graph.config_io`` (not
``graph.config``) — it is imported from there below.

KNOWN GAPS (documented as ``strict=True`` xfails so they auto-flip to a LOUD
failure the moment the refactor closes them):

* ``identity.org`` (attr ``identity_org``) — RESOLVED in PR-2: the dataclass field
  + the ``from_yaml`` parse line were added, so the white-label org label persists
  now. ``ATTR_MISSING_KEYS`` is empty and test #1's ``identity.org`` param passes
  normally (the strict xfail is gone).
* ``config_to_dict`` was PARTIAL — RESOLVED in PR-3: it is now FIELDS-driven and
  serializes ALL FIELDS keys (the 27 previously-missing keys — routing, compaction,
  goal, execute_code, prompt_cache, several checkpoint/knowledge/telemetry keys,
  agent_runtime, operator_mcp.tools, middleware.enforcement — are now emitted).
  ``CONFIG_TO_DICT_MISSING_KEYS`` is therefore empty, the per-key strict xfails in
  test #2 are gone (every key passes normally), and
  ``test_config_to_dict_missing_set_is_exactly_as_expected`` asserts it stays empty.
