"""Chat backend — the LangGraph turn loop behind every entry point.

Extracted from ``server/__init__.py`` (ADR 0023, phase 2). This module owns the
non-streaming ``chat`` (the console + OpenAI-compat) and streaming
``_chat_langgraph_stream`` (the A2A handler) turn drivers, the shared
``_run_turn_stream`` event loop, tool-preview/interrupt shaping, and slash-command

It depends only on neutral modules (``runtime.state``, ``graph.output_format``)

import cycle. ``server/__init__.py`` re-exports every public name so
``server.<symbol>`` keeps resolving for the OpenAI-compat / A2A wiring in
