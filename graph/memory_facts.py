"""Semantic fact extraction for the session-end memory pass (ADR 0021).

The episodic side (``conversation_harvest``) summarizes a retired thread. This
is the **semantic** side: distil discrete, durable *facts* worth recalling in a
future, unrelated conversation — user preferences, decisions, stable facts about
their world/projects — and store them as ``finding_type="fact"``.

Two rules from the ADR:

- **Extract, don't dump.** The aux model returns short fact strings, not a
  transcript. Importance gating lives in the prompt — transient task state and
  pleasantries are dropped; a chatty turn with nothing durable yields ``[]``.
- **Consolidate.** Before inserting, near-identical facts already in the store
  (scoped to the same ``namespace``) are skipped, so memory doesn't accrete
  duplicates. (Superseding an *outdated* fact with a newer one is an LLM-judged
  refinement left for a follow-up; v1 dedups conservatively.)

Facts carry a ``namespace`` so per-project/owner scoping (ADR 0007) is a filter
later, not a migration.
