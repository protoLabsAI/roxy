"""Layered knowledge (ADR 0041 slice 3 / bd-2wu) — read COMMONS ∪ PRIVATE, write private.

The knowledge analog of :mod:`graph.skills.layered`. An agent reads both the shared
**commons** knowledge library (host-level, read by every agent on the box) and its own
**private** store, but **writes go to private** — so an agent's in-progress facts never
pollute the fleet. Sharing is **promotion-defined**: an operator explicitly promotes
a proven private chunk into the commons (curated, never automatic — ADR 0041). It's the
"shared brain, private hands" model, same as skills.

Search **fuses both tiers** with a second-level RRF over rank (each tier already did its
own FTS5 ∪ vector RRF internally). All other methods — writes, hot memory, deletes, stats,
ingestion — **delegate to private** via ``__getattr__``; only ``search``/``list_chunks``
(which union tiers) and ``promote``/``forget_from_commons`` (commons curation) are
overridden. Drop-in for ``KnowledgeStore`` everywhere the runtime uses it.
