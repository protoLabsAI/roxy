# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture significant architectural decisions — the context, the options
considered, the decision, and its consequences — so the *why* survives the
people who made it.

Format: lightweight [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-style. One file per
decision, numbered, never deleted (supersede instead).
