"""Unified delegate registry — `delegate_to` over a2a / openai / acp (ADR 0025).

One tool, ``delegate_to(target, query)``, dispatches to any configured delegate:
a fleet **A2A agent**, an OpenAI-compatible **model endpoint**, or an **ACP coding
agent**. Replaces the three split surfaces (`peer_consult`, `code_with`, and the
gateway-only model) with one hot-swappable roster.

PR1 (this slice): the registry + `delegate_to` + the three adapters, configured
via the ``delegates`` config section and hot-reloaded by Save & Reload. The CRUD
REST API (PR2) and the React panel (PR3) build on this. Ships disabled — enable
with ``plugins: { enabled: [delegates] }`` and declare delegates in config.
