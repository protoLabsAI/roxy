# Python deps — installed from requirements.txt so the runtime image stays
# in lockstep with local + CI installs. A hand-maintained list here drifts
# (it had silently lost `croniter`, which the scheduler imports). Copy just
# the requirements first so this layer stays cached across source-only
# changes. Forks that need extras (agent-browser, sqlite-vec, pyjwt[crypto])
# add them to requirements.txt.
# UI tier (ADR 0010): default 'none' builds the LEAN image (core deps, no
# Gradio) for a headless server. `--build-arg UI=full` adds the Gradio UI for an
# all-in-one image. Both requirements files are copied so requirements.txt's
# `-r` includes resolve. PROTOAGENT_UI is baked so the server runs the matching
