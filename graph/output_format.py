"""Structured output protocol for protoAgent — `<scratch_pad>` / `<output>` tags.

The model is instructed to wrap internal deliberation in ``<scratch_pad>``
and the user-facing answer in ``<output>``. Server-side, we parse those
tags and forward only the ``<output>`` content to consumers (A2A
artifacts, Gradio chat, subagent return values).

We deliberately do NOT parse the protocol mid-stream — chunk-boundary
tag splitting turned that into a state-machine rabbit hole and the
per-token text rendering consumers were doing didn't add real value.
Instead, ``_chat_langgraph_stream`` accumulates the model's tokens
silently while still emitting tool-start / tool-end status events, then
passes the complete text through ``extract_output`` once on the
terminal ``done`` frame. The consumer sees tool progress during the run
and the clean final artifact at completion.

``_strip_reasoning`` also removes provider-emitted ``<think>...</think>``
regions (LiteLLM bug #22392 leaks these as raw tags from MiniMax) and
any orphaned scratch_pad / think openings.

The prompt fragment that teaches the protocol to the model lives in
``OUTPUT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS`` below; ``graph.prompts`` appends it to
both the lead agent and subagent system prompts.

# Response format

Structure every response as:

    <scratch_pad>
    Internal reasoning — which tools to call, what you're learning from
    each result, how you'll assemble the final answer. This is not shown
    to the user; use it freely to think.
    </scratch_pad>
    <output>
    The user-facing answer. This is what lands in the A2A artifact /
    Discord / Gradio chat. Be clean, scannable, markdown-formatted.
    </output>

Rules:
- Always emit both tags, in that order, exactly once.
- Never include literal `<scratch_pad>` or `<output>` markers inside the
  user-facing content.
- Keep tool-calling deliberation in `<scratch_pad>`. Keep only the
  finished, customer-ready answer in `<output>`.
- If you must defer or ask for clarification, put the question inside
  `<output>` too — the user never sees `<scratch_pad>`.

## When the task needs tools: act first, then answer

`<output>` is your FINAL result, written AFTER the work is done — never a
"working on it" placeholder. While you still have tools to call you have not
reached `<output>` yet: keep the running narration ("checking the board",
"auto-mode is off, starting it") in `<scratch_pad>`. Emit `<output>` once, on
your last turn, holding the complete result. A turn that calls a tool *and*
writes a progress line into `<output>` burns your one `<output>` on "doing it
now" — the user then sees only that and never the actual result. So: narrate in
scratch_pad across every intermediate step; produce `<output>` only when you
have the answer.

### Example — "sweep the board and get it moving"

    <scratch_pad>
    Plan: check auto-mode, list features, decide, then summarize.
    [get_auto_mode_status → OFF] [list_features → 6 ready, 0 running]
    Ready work + no agent → start it. [start_auto_mode → ok, 1 agent now running]
    Now I have the result; write the roll-up.
    </scratch_pad>
    <output>
    **protocli — ✓ now flowing.** Auto-mode was OFF with 6 ready features and no
    agent; I started it. 1 agent now running on the streaming-timeout fix.
    </output>

The narration ("check auto-mode", "start it") stayed in scratch_pad; `<output>`
is the single finished summary — not "Sweeping the board now…".

Optionally, after `</output>`, you may self-report confidence:

    <confidence>0.85</confidence>
    <confidence_explanation>one short sentence on what drove the score</confidence_explanation>

- `<confidence>` is a number in [0, 1] — your honest self-assessment of
  whether the answer is correct/complete. Omit it if you'd only be guessing.
- `<confidence_explanation>` is optional. Neither tag is shown to the user;
  they ride a confidence-v1 DataPart on the A2A artifact.
