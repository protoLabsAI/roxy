# ADR 0023: server.py was promoted to a `server/` package. Launch it as a
# module with the install dir on PYTHONPATH so the package (and its sibling
# top-level modules: paths, events, graph, …) resolve, while keeping the
# agent's workspace (/sandbox) as the working directory.
#
# Bind all interfaces inside the container — the boundary is the published port
# + network policy, not the in-container bind. (The server defaults to loopback
# for local/desktop runs; PROTOAGENT_HOST overrides either way.)
