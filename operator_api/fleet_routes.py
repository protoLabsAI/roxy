The endpoints the CLI (`python -m server fleet`) and the desktop GUI panels both
drive — list / create / start / stop agents, and list archetypes for the new-agent
picker. Mounted by ``register_fleet_routes(app)``. The reverse proxy (in-place switch
of the *active* agent) is a separate slice; these are the lifecycle + catalog routes.

Errors degrade to HTTP 400 with a readable message (never a 500), so a panel can show
