# Delegates — the agents & endpoints your agent can talk to

A **built-in registry** ([ADR 0025](/adr/0025-unified-delegate-registry-and-panel))
that gives the lead agent **one tool — `delegate_to(target, query)`** — over a
unified roster of delegates it can hand work to:

| `type` | What it is | Dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| **a2a** | A fleet **agent** over the A2A protocol | JSON-RPC `message/send` (+ poll) |
| **openai** | An OpenAI-compatible **model endpoint** — ask another model | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| **acp** | A CLI **coding agent** (protoCLI, Claude Code, …) over ACP | the ADR 0024 `AcpClient` |

This unifies what used to be three separate things — `peer_consult` (a2a),
`code_with` (acp), and "no way to ask another model" — into one hot-swappable
roster.

Manage delegates three ways: the **console panel** (Workspace settings ▸
Delegates), a **REST API**, or **config** — all hot-swappable (changes apply on
the next turn, no restart). See [ADR 0025](/adr/0025-unified-delegate-registry-and-panel).

## Manage in the console (panel)

Open **Workspace settings ▸ Delegates** (a built-in — always on, alongside Tools,
MCP, and Subagents). The panel:

- **lists** your delegates with a type badge, a `secret set` / `⚠ unconfigured`
  marker, a **live health dot** (a background prober probes each delegate
  periodically — green reachable / red down / grey not-yet-checked), and a per-row
  **Test** button for an on-demand probe. For an `acp` (coding-agent) delegate the
  probe runs only the ACP `initialize` handshake — **not** a session — so it's cheap
  and side-effect-free, never opening a thread against the agent on a timer
  ([#1300](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoAgent/issues/1300));
- **adds** one via a **type picker** (A2A agent / Model endpoint / Coding agent)
  and a form generated from each type's field schema;
- **edits / deletes** existing ones; secrets you enter are routed to
  `secrets.yaml` and never shown back (the form says *"set — leave blank to keep"*).

Saving writes the config + secret and hot-reloads, so the new roster is live on
the next turn.

## Declare delegates

The registry is a **built-in** — always on, can't be disabled, and managed in
**Workspace settings ▸ Delegates** (no plugin to install or turn on). It does
nothing until you declare a delegate, so just add entries:

```yaml
# config/langgraph-config.yaml
delegates:
  - name: helm                      # the name the LLM passes to delegate_to(target=…)
    type: a2a
    description: Chief of staff — planning, fleet coordination.
    url: https://helm.example/a2a
    auth: { scheme: bearer }        # token from secrets.yaml (below) or *_env

  - name: opus
    type: openai
    description: Heavy reasoning model for deep analysis.
    url: https://api.proto-labs.ai/v1
    model: protolabs/reasoning
    system_prompt: "Answer thoroughly but concisely."

  - name: proto
    type: acp
    description: Terminal coding agent for this repo.
    command: proto
    args: ["--acp"]
    workdir: ~/dev/my-repo
    permissions: allowlist          # auto | allowlist | readonly (see ADR 0024)
```

`delegates` is a **top-level list** (ORBIS-style), not a plugin config section.
Editing it and hitting **Save & Reload** rebuilds the roster live — no restart
(protoAgent re-runs the plugin's `register()` with the new config).

## Use it

```
delegate_to(target="opus", query="What are the trade-offs of X vs Y? Be concise.")
delegate_to(target="proto", query="Add a /healthz route and run the tests.")
delegate_to(target="helm", query="What's the current sprint status?")
```

The configured delegate names + descriptions appear in the tool's description, so
the model knows what it can reach. Each delegate is stateless from the caller's
view — the `query` must be self-contained (the delegate doesn't see this chat).

## Secrets

Auth tokens / API keys are stored in the gitignored `config/secrets.yaml`, never
in the tracked config or in API responses — the same handling as the Discord /
Google tokens. For PR1 you can either:

- set the value in `secrets.yaml` (merged into the delegate at load), or
- reference an env var: `auth: { scheme: bearer, credentialsEnv: HELM_TOKEN }`
  (a2a) / `api_key_env: GATEWAY_KEY` (openai).

## Manage via the REST API

The plugin mounts a CRUD surface (operator-console posture — localhost-default,
bearer-when-exposed, like `/api/config`). The console panel (PR3) is built on it;
you can also drive it directly:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/delegate-types` | type list + field schema (drives the form) |
| GET | `/api/delegates` | list delegates (secret-free; `configured` + `has_secret` flags) |
| POST | `/api/delegates` | create (409 if the name exists) |
| PUT | `/api/delegates/{name}` | update |
| DELETE | `/api/delegates/{name}` | remove |
| POST | `/api/delegates/test` | reachability probe of an entry (the **Test** button) |

Create/update/delete **write the config + route the secret to `secrets.yaml`**,
then hot-reload — so the roster is live on the next turn, no restart. A secret you
send in `auth.token` / `api_key` is stored under the `delegate_secrets` overlay
and **never returned** by `GET /api/delegates`; `has_secret` tells the panel one
is stored.

```bash
curl -s localhost:7870/api/delegate-types | jq '.types[].type'
curl -s -X POST localhost:7870/api/delegates -d '{"name":"opus","type":"openai",
  "url":"https://api.proto-labs.ai/v1","model":"protolabs/reasoning","api_key":"…"}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:7870/api/delegates/test -d '{"type":"a2a","url":"https://peer/a2a"}'
```

## Relationship to `code_with` / `peer_consult`

`delegate_to` supersedes them: an `acp` delegate is what `code_with` did, and an
`a2a` delegate is what `peer_consult` did. **`code_with` has been removed** (the
`coding_agent` plugin is now just the shared ACP client library); `peer_consult`
remains, deprecated, for back-compat. New setups use `delegates` + `delegate_to`.
