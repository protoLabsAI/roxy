"""Agent-process lifecycle (ADR 0042 slice 1).

Starts a workspace agent as a **detached background process** (``python -m server
--ui none`` with the workspace's config-dir + instance + port, via
``workspaces.manager.run_exec``), stops it (SIGTERM → reap), and reports status. A
small JSON registry (``<workspaces_root>/fleet.json``) survives the supervisor CLI's
own exit — the agents outlive it, so subsequent ``ls``/``down`` can find them.

Pure orchestration: an agent is an ordinary server; the supervisor just owns its
process. Session continuity is free (each agent's stores are ``instance.id``-scoped).
