# Build an operator fork (like "Roxy")

protoAgent ships the **primitives** for a multi-project operator agent — a
fenced filesystem toolset, a project registry, and the reactive substrate
(scheduler / inbox / Activity). The *operator* itself — a persona that monitors
several workspaces and keeps work flowing — is a **fork**, assembled from those
primitives + the standard specialization mechanisms ([ADR 0007](/adr/0007-directory-aware-operator-agent)).
No operator code lives in the template; a fork is persona + skill + config.

This guide builds "Roxy", a ProtoMaker portfolio manager that **monitors and
unblocks** (it does not write code).

## 1. Fork the template

Create a new repo from protoAgent (it's a GitHub template). Keep upstream so you
can pull future primitive updates.

## 2. Enable the fenced filesystem toolset (read-only for a monitor)

```yaml
# config/langgraph-config.yaml
filesystem:
  enabled: true
  allow_run: true          # Roxy needs git/gh/br reads — run_command, fenced cwd
  projects:
    - { name: orbis,    path: /work/ORBIS,    write: false }   # monitor, never edit
    - { name: pixelgen, path: /work/pixelgen, write: false }
```

A monitor sets every project `write: false` — `read_file`/`list_dir`/
`find_files`/`search_files` + `run_command` give it everything it needs to
*sense* state; `write_file`/`edit_file` are refused. (A coding fork would set
`write: true` and lean on git-as-seatbelt.)

## 3. Write the operator persona (`config/SOUL.md`)

The persona makes it a monitor-and-unblock manager, not a coder. Sketch:

```markdown
# Roxy — ProtoMaker Portfolio Manager

You manage a portfolio of ProtoMaker workspaces. Your job is to **keep work
flowing**: watch each project's board + PRs, spot stalls and blockers, and
**unblock** — by nudging/creating features, escalating to a human, or
dispatching the ProtoMaker team. You **do not write code yourself**; you
monitor, coordinate, and escalate. Prefer the smallest action that unblocks;
escalate anything consequential.
```

## 4. Add a `project-operations` skill (`config/skills/project-operations/SKILL.md`)

This is where the ProtoMaker-specific knowledge lives — *how* to read a
workspace's state with the generic tools (so the template stays domain-neutral):

```markdown
---
name: project-operations
description: >-
  Use whenever asked to check status, sweep projects, or unblock work. How to
  read a ProtoMaker workspace and decide if work is flowing.
tools: [list_projects, read_file, find_files, search_files, run_command, check_inbox, schedule_task]
---

# Keeping a portfolio flowing

For each project: read the board (`read_file .beads/issues.jsonl` → counts by
status, blocked items), the feature pipeline (`find_files .automaker/**`), and
git (`run_command "git status"`, `run_command "gh pr list"`). A project is
**stalled** if: open features with no active work, PRs idle > N days, CI red, or
a dirty tree on main. Summarize per project (flowing / stalled / blocked), then
**unblock**: nudge the team, open an issue, or escalate to the operator.
```

## 5. Wire the drivers

- **Summon via A2A** — Roxy is reached over the A2A endpoint (`message/send` /
  `message/stream`); set an `auth.token` so inbound is authenticated.
- **The Workstacean bus** — protoWorkstacean dispatches to Roxy as an A2A agent
  (it already speaks the `cost-v1`/`confidence-v1` extensions Roxy emits).
- **Scheduled sweeps** — a periodic `schedule_task` (or an external cron hitting
  A2A) fires a "sweep all projects" turn; the skill + persona do the rest.
- **Escalation** — surfaces via the inbox / Activity thread (ADR 0003).
- **(Optional) richer board actions** — add the `protolabs_studio` MCP server to
  `mcp.servers` for `query_board` / `start_agent` / `get_sitrep` etc.

## 6. Deploy isolated + headless

Give Roxy its own `PROTOAGENT_INSTANCE` (ADR 0004) so its stores don't collide
with other agents on shared storage; run it on its own port / container. A
monitor has no operator at a browser, so run the **lean, UI-less tier**
([ADR 0010](/adr/0010-headless-setup-and-ui-tiers)): `--ui none` (or
`PROTOAGENT_UI=none`) serves only API + A2A + `/metrics` — no Gradio, no console,
core deps only. Drop the live config + supply the gateway key via env, and setup
auto-completes on boot (or run `python server.py --setup` once); `GET /healthz`
reports readiness. The default Docker image already builds this lean tier.

---

That's the whole operator: **primitives (template) + persona + skill + config
(fork)**. Nothing about ProtoMaker or "portfolio management" ships in protoAgent
core — it stays a neutral template, and Roxy is a thin specialization.
