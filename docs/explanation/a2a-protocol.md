# A2A protocol

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is a JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with SSE streaming for agent-to-agent communication. The full spec lives at [a2a-protocol.org](https://a2a-protocol.org/). This page covers what the template handles and where naive implementations tend to go wrong.

## The happy path

Consumer POSTs to `/a2a`:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "1", "method": "message/stream", "params": {...}}
```

Server responds with an SSE stream. Each event is a JSON frame:

```
event: task
data: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "1", "result": {"kind": "task", ...}}

event: status-update
data: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "1", "result": {"kind": "status-update", ...}}

...
```

That's it. Everything else — skills, extensions, push notifications — layers onto this.

## The `kind` discriminator is not optional

Every SSE frame must carry one of:

- `"kind": "task"` (first frame — full Task object)
- `"kind": "status-update"` (state transitions, tool progress)
- `"kind": "artifact-update"` (streaming artifacts)

The assistant's answer streams incrementally: `artifact-update` frames with `append: true` carry each new suffix as the model generates it, and a final `append: false` frame replaces the artifact with the authoritative full text. Only the user-facing `<output>` region streams — the server's `stream_visible_output` holds back the `<scratch_pad>` and any partial trailing tag, and the terminal `extract_output` reconciles the result. Consumers that only want the final answer can ignore the deltas and read the last `append: false` frame.

`@a2a-js/sdk`'s `for await` loop routes frames by `kind`. Without the field, the loop silently skips every frame and consumers never attach. The template's regression test `test_message_stream_events_have_kind_discriminator` locks this in — inline dict construction is the path of least resistance and also the easiest way to forget this field.

## Camel-case vs snake-case

Wire fields are camelCase: `taskId`, `contextId`, `durationMs`. Python code is snake_case: `task_id`, `context_id`, `duration_ms`. The A2A handler is the translation boundary. Don't leak snake_case into wire responses.

## Push notification tokens — two shapes

The A2A spec permits two equivalent ways to carry the shared-secret token:

**Shape 1 — top-level `token`** (what `@a2a-js/sdk` serializes by default):

```json
{"url": "https://consumer/callback/abc", "token": "shared-secret"}
```

**Shape 2 — structured `authentication.credentials`** (RFC-8821 AuthenticationInfo):

```json
{
  "url": "https://consumer/callback/abc",
  "authentication": {"schemes": ["Bearer"], "credentials": "shared-secret"}
}
```

Both are active spec — neither is deprecated. Different consumers use different shapes. If your handler only reads one, half of real-world consumers will register a webhook, receive HTTP 401s on every delivery, and silently fall back to polling. The template's `_extract_push_token` accepts both; when both are present, top-level wins.

## SSRF is a real risk

A webhook URL is an outbound HTTP call this agent makes with a shared secret attached. If a malicious (or careless) consumer registers:

- `http://169.254.169.254/...` — cloud metadata endpoint
- `http://10.0.0.1/...` — LAN router
- `http://localhost/...` — sibling services on the host
- `http://internal-db:5432/...` — adjacent services on the docker network

...the agent would happily POST task payloads (potentially with `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`) to any of them.

`is_safe_webhook_url` in `a2a_stores.py` resolves the URL's hostname once and rejects anything that lands in a private range. It's not a full DNS-rebinding defence, but it closes the "just use an RFC1918 literal" vector. Operator allowlists (`PUSH_NOTIFICATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) bypass the check for trusted docker-network targets that would otherwise fail.

## Task lifecycle

```
SUBMITTED → WORKING → COMPLETED
                    ↘ FAILED
                    ↘ CANCELED
```

All three terminal states fire push notifications (if configured). Terminal tasks stay in memory until a background sweeper eventually discards them — in the meantime, `tasks/get` + `tasks/resubscribe` both work.

`tasks/resubscribe` is the reconnect mechanism. If a streaming consumer's connection drops mid-run, they POST `tasks/resubscribe` with the task ID and get the remaining frames. The template keeps a buffer of emitted frames per task to serve resubscriptions reliably.

## Trace propagation — not in the spec

The template reads `params.metadata["a2a.trace"]` on incoming requests:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "a2a.trace": {
      "traceId": "abc123",
      "spanId": "def456"
    }
  }
}
```

This is a protoLabs convention, not part of the A2A spec. It's how the fleet ties multi-agent Langfuse traces together. Consumers that don't know about it just don't stamp the field — the agent's trace becomes a standalone root instead of a child. No breakage.

## What the template doesn't do

- **Long-lived tasks**: the template doesn't persist tasks across restarts. If you need durable task state, swap `_store` for a Redis/SQLite-backed impl.
- **Multi-tenancy**: every task sees the same auth context. If you need per-caller isolation, extend the API-key middleware.
- **OAuth**: only API-key auth ships. A2A security schemes allow OAuth2; wire it up in `_build_agent_card.securitySchemes` + middleware if needed.
