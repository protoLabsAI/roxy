"""Agent initialization, the component builders, hot-reload, and settings.

Extracted from ``server/__init__.py`` (ADR 0023, phase 2). This module owns the
composition of the LangGraph agent from config: ``_init_langgraph_agent`` and the
``_build_*`` builders (knowledge / skills / MCP / plugins / checkpointer / inbox /
activity / telemetry / workflow / scheduler), the checkpoint-prune + thread-retire
loops, the plugin host wiring, ``_reload_langgraph_agent`` (the hot-reload path),
and the settings-callbacks the operator console drives.

The builders read and mutate the shared ``runtime.state.STATE`` container; the few
``server/__init__`` symbols they need (``agent_name``, ``AGENT_NAME_ENV``,
``_event_bus``, ``_bundle_root``) are imported from ``server`` — all defined
before the re-export line in ``__init__`` that triggers this import, so it is not
a cycle. ``server/__init__.py`` re-exports every public name so ``server.<symbol>``
keeps resolving for ``_main``'s wiring and for the test suite.
