"""Host services a plugin surface/route can reach (ADR 0018+).

A plugin's *tools* run inside the graph, but a *surface* (an ingress gateway like
Discord) needs to call the agent and the event bus — host services it can't
construct itself. The server **populates** these once, before the startup hook
fires; a plugin reads them at surface-start time, via ``registry.host`` (the same
singleton) or ``from graph.plugins.host import HOST``.

Each is optional (``None`` until the server wires it / in a non-server context),
so a plugin guards: ``if registry.host.invoke: ...``.
