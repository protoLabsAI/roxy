# Changelog

All notable changes to protoAgent are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Add your entries under [Unreleased]** in your PR. When a release is cut,
> `prepare-release.yml` rolls them into a dated, versioned section via
> `scripts/changelog.py`. See [Releasing](docs/guides/releasing.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Operator primitives** (ADR 0007): a fenced multi-project filesystem toolset
  (`tools/fs_tools.py`) + project registry — opt-in, off by default. Enables a
  fork like Roxy; the agent's own repo is excluded by default.
- **Sandboxing** (ADR 0008): a deny-by-default `egress.allowed_hosts` allowlist
  enforced in `fetch_url`, and `scripts/gen_openshell_policy.py` to generate an
  NVIDIA OpenShell sandbox policy from config (project registry → Landlock
  paths, egress allowlist + gateway → network policy). New guides:
  "Build an operator fork (Roxy)" and "Sandboxing & egress".

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Compaction telemetry signal (`*_compactions_total`, ADR 0006): with routing +
  tool deferral + compaction now all measured, every optimization lever the
  agent has is observable (`/api/telemetry/insights` `unproven_levers` is empty).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Observability & the self-improving flywheel** (ADR 0006): measure → persist
  → surface → advise.
  - Per-LLM-call telemetry at the streaming seam: prompt-cache tokens, per-call
    latency, model, and USD cost (`pricing.py`); wired the previously-dead
    Prometheus LLM metrics (calls, latency, tokens, cache, cost).
  - `cost-v1` A2A artifact now carries Anthropic-shaped cache fields + `costUsd`
    and the agent declares the `cost-v1` extension in its card (fleet alignment).
  - Local `TelemetryStore` (per-turn rollups) + read API
    `/api/telemetry/summary` · `/recent` · `/insights`.
  - **System ▸ Telemetry** operator-console dashboard: cost, cache-hit %,
    p50/p95 latency, by-model + recent-turns tables, and an advise-only Insights
    panel (flags ≥5× median cost/latency turns, proves the cache lever in $).
  - Per-turn actual-model routing (`model`/`models`) + a
    `*_llm_tools_deferred_total` Prometheus counter proving tool deferral.

### Changed
- `costUsd` is computed in-process from a pricing table (consumers prefer it
  over recomputing from tokens).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- MCP per-server tool allowlist (`tools.include` / `tools.exclude`) and lazy
  `enabled: false` connect, bounding the per-turn tool-schema footprint
  (ADR 0005 #1).
- Skills surface their declared `tools:` to the agent as `<relevant_tools>`
  when retrieved — a relevance hint, not a gate (ADR 0005 #2).
- Opt-in deferred tools + a `search_tools` meta-tool for progressive tool
  disclosure at high tool counts (`tools.deferred`, ADR 0005 #3).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), following Keep a Changelog.

### Changed
- Releases are now cut **manually** via `workflow_dispatch` (choose
  patch/minor/major) instead of auto-bumping on every merge to `main`.
- `main` is protected by a repository ruleset: a PR and the three CI checks
  (Verify workspace config, Python tests, Web E2E smoke) are required to merge.

### Docs
- ADR 0005 — Tool Pollution & Progressive Tool Disclosure.
- Releasing runbook (`docs/guides/releasing.md`).
