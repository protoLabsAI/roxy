# Install & publish plugins (git URLs)

Plugins can live in their own GitHub repo and be installed by URL — so you can
make one and share it, and pull others in. A plugin repo is a **full bundle**: it
can contribute tools, subagents, SKILL.md skills, workflows, console views, routes,
MCP servers, and config — all from the one repo. See
[ADR 0027](/adr/0027-install-plugins-from-git-url) for the design + safety model.

## Install one

**CLI:**
```sh
python -m server plugin install https://github.com/owner/protoagent-plugin-x --ref v1.0
python -m server plugin list
python -m server plugin uninstall protoagent-plugin-x            # code + lock + enabled ref
python -m server plugin uninstall protoagent-plugin-x --purge    # also config section + secrets
python -m server plugin sync          # re-clone the locked set (CI / fresh checkout)
python -m server plugin install-deps protoagent-plugin-x   # explicit, separate
```

**Uninstall removes** the plugin's code, its `plugins.lock` entry, and its
`plugins.enabled` reference (so nothing dangles). It **keeps** the plugin's config
section + secrets by default (a reinstall restores your settings); pass `--purge`
to remove those too. Declared pip deps are **never** auto-removed (shared venv) —
they're reported so you can `pip uninstall` them if unused.

**Console:** Settings → Integrations → **Plugins** — paste the URL, review the
manifest + capabilities, install, uninstall.

Either way, **install fetches code only — it does not enable or run it.** To
enable: add the plugin's id to `plugins.enabled` in your config and restart.

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: [protoagent-plugin-x]
```

Install pins the **resolved commit SHA** and records it in a committed
`plugins.lock`, so `plugin sync` reproduces the exact set. The code itself is
gitignored (re-cloned from the lock).

## Publish one

> **Start from the devkit.** Enable the bundled **`plugin-devkit`** plugin
> (`plugins: { enabled: [plugin-devkit] }`) — it's the canonical full-bundle
> example *and* it gives the agent a `scaffold_plugin` tool, a `plugin-architect`
> subagent + `design-plugin` workflow, and the `building-plugins` skill. With it
> on, just ask the agent to *"build a plugin that …"* and it scaffolds a working
> skeleton for you to fill in.

A plugin is a directory (its own repo) with a manifest + a `register()`. The
**conventional layout** — everything here is picked up when the plugin is enabled:

```
my-plugin/
  protoagent.plugin.yaml      # manifest (id, name, version, requires_pip, views, …)
  __init__.py                 # def register(registry): … — tools, subagents, etc.
  skills/                     # SKILL.md skills — auto-discovered (data, no code)
    my-skill/SKILL.md
  workflows/                  # *.yaml workflow recipes — auto-discovered (data)
    my-recipe.yaml
```

`register(registry)` contributes the **code** extensions:

```python
def register(registry):
    registry.register_tool(my_tool)            # a LangChain tool
    registry.register_subagent(my_subagent)    # a SubagentConfig
    registry.register_router(my_router)         # FastAPI routes at /plugins/<id>
    registry.register_mcp_server(my_factory)    # a managed MCP server
    # skills/ and workflows/ are auto-discovered — no call needed. For a
    # non-standard location: registry.register_workflow_dir("recipes")
```

`skills/` and `workflows/` are **data**, so they're auto-discovered from those
conventional subdirs — no boilerplate. **Console views** (a rail icon + page) are
declared in the manifest — see [Plugin console views](/guides/plugin-views).

Declare pip dependencies (they are **not** auto-installed — see Safety):

```yaml
# protoagent.plugin.yaml
id: my-plugin
name: My Plugin
version: 1.0.0
repository: https://github.com/owner/my-plugin
requires_pip: ["httpx>=0.27"]
min_protoagent_version: "0.20.0"
```

## Safety

The model is **informed trust + a verifiable supply chain**, not a sandbox — an
enabled plugin runs in-process *as the agent* (like a pip dependency). So:

- **Install ≠ enable ≠ trust.** Installing only fetches code + reads the manifest
  (data); it never imports the plugin. Enabling (`plugins.enabled`) is the trust
  decision — review the manifest + capabilities first.
- **Deps are explicit.** `requires_pip` is declared, never auto-installed (pip runs
  arbitrary build code). Run `plugin install-deps <id>` after reviewing them; a
  missing dep gives a clear "run install-deps" message on enable.
- **Pinned + reproducible.** Installs pin a commit SHA in `plugins.lock`.
- **Optional source allowlist.** Lock installs down to trusted orgs:
  ```yaml
  plugins:
    sources:
      allow: ["github.com/yourorg/*"]
  ```
- **Audited.** install / uninstall / install-deps are written to the audit log.
- **Untrusted code? Use [MCP](/guides/mcp) instead** — it runs out-of-process and
  is sandboxable. Git plugins are for code you've reviewed and trust.
