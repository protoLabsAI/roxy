"""Harvest a retired conversation into the searchable knowledge base.

When a chat thread is retired — aged out by the checkpoint pruner, or explicitly
deleted — we don't just drop it: we summarize it and ingest the summary into the
``KnowledgeStore`` (FTS5 + embeddings), so the substance becomes searchable via
``memory_recall`` while the bulky raw checkpoints are reclaimed. Save space,
keep the signal.

The summary is produced by the cheap aux model (``routing.aux_model``) — it's
classification-grade work, not the main reasoning task.
