# How-To Guides

Task-oriented procedures. Assumes you already have a running agent (see [Tutorials](/tutorials/) if not — the wizard runs with zero setup).

| Guide | When to read |
|---|---|
| [Customize & deploy](/guides/customize-and-deploy) | You've evaluated via the wizard and now want to fork, rename, and ship your own image |
| [Fork checklist (fast path)](/guides/fork-the-template) | Terser version of the above for experienced forkers |
| [Add a custom skill (A2A card)](/guides/add-a-skill) | You want A2A callers to dispatch a named capability — a *card* skill, distinct from the `SKILL.md` skills below |
| [Configure subagents](/guides/subagents) | You want specialized delegates beyond the shipped `researcher` |
| [Reusable workflows](/guides/workflows) | You want declarative multi-step recipes (`*.yaml`) the agent can run on demand |
| [Skills (`SKILL.md`)](/guides/skills) | You want to drop in reusable, auto-retrieved skill instructions in the AgentSkills `SKILL.md` format |
| [Connect MCP servers](/guides/mcp) | You want to plug external tools into the agent via the Model Context Protocol (stdio / HTTP) |
| [Plugins](/guides/plugins) | You want drop-in packages that add tools, skills, routes, background surfaces, subagents and managed MCP servers without forking (Discord + Google ship this way) |
| [Plugin console views](/guides/plugin-views) | You want a plugin to add its own left-rail icon + view (dashboard) to the console |
| [Install & publish plugins (git URLs)](/guides/plugin-registry) | You want to install a plugin from a git URL, or publish one as a shareable repo (tools + skills + subagents + workflows + views) |
| [Goal mode](/guides/goal-mode) | You want the agent to pursue a standing goal across turns, not just answer one-shot |
| [Schedule future work](/guides/scheduler) | You want the agent to defer tasks to itself ("remind me tomorrow", recurring sweeps) — local sqlite or Workstacean-backed |
| [Discord surface](/guides/discord) | You want the agent reachable from Discord (the first-party `discord` plugin) |
| [Google (Gmail + Calendar)](/guides/google) | You want the agent to read mail / manage the calendar (the `google` plugin) |
| [Spawn CLI coding agents (ACP)](/guides/coding-agents) | You want the agent to drive a CLI coding agent (e.g. protoCLI) over the Agent Client Protocol |
| [Delegates (agents & endpoints)](/guides/delegates) | You want to manage the agents + endpoints your agent talks to via `delegate_to` (a2a / openai / acp), hot-swappable from the console |
| [React + Tauri UI](/guides/react-tauri-ui) | You want the multi-chat React console and to package it for desktop |
| [Wire Langfuse + Prometheus](/guides/observability) | You need traces and metrics in production |
| [Run multiple instances](/guides/multi-instance) | You want several scoped agents (data isolation) on one host |
| [Deploy via GHCR](/guides/deploy) | You're ready to ship and want auto-deploy wired up |
| [Releasing](/guides/releasing) | You're cutting a versioned release (semver bump → image → GitHub release) |
| [Build an operator fork (Roxy)](/guides/operator-fork) | You're building a portfolio-manager / operator agent on top of the template |
| [Sync a fork from upstream](/guides/upstream-sync) | Your fork needs to pull fixes + features down from the template (merge-not-squash) |
| [Sandboxing & egress](/guides/sandboxing) | You want to fence the filesystem + outbound network |
| [Eval your fork](/guides/evals) | You want a baseline pass-rate for the tools / memory / A2A surface in your fork |
