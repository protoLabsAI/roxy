# Customize & deploy

Use this guide when you've run through the wizard, decided the template fits your use case, and now want to fork it into your own GitHub repo + ship a deployable image. If you're still evaluating, stay on the [first-agent tutorial](/tutorials/first-agent) — you don't need any of this to run the agent locally.

## Why this is a separate step

The [setup wizard](/tutorials/first-agent) handles runtime customization — model, tools, persona, auth — without editing code. Everything below is structural: renaming the template throughout the codebase, bending the release pipeline to your repo, baking your fork's identity into the Docker image. Do it once per fork, not every time you tweak a setting.

## The operator-fork contract

**Fork identity and behavior are config/plugin-driven. If you're editing a core `.py` to customize, that's a missing seam — [file it](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoAgent/issues).** A fork that *adds* (new files: `config/`, `plugins/`, new modules) syncs upstream with near-zero conflicts; one that *edits* upstream-owned core files fights every sync. The template exposes a seam for each common customization so you stay on the add-only side:

| You want to customize… | Seam (declare/add — don't edit core) |
|---|---|
| Advertised skills + card description | `a2a.skills` / `a2a.description` in config, or `register_a2a_skill` (#570) |
| Add / drop tools | `register_tools` plugin / `tools.disabled` (no core edit) |
| Where a turn's memory lives (`thread_id`) | `register_thread_id_resolver` plugin (#571) |
| Lock outbound callbacks / peer consults | `security.callback_allowlist` CIDRs in config (#572) |
| Outbound host allowlist for `fetch_url` | `egress.allowed_hosts` in config |
| Subagents | `register_subagent` plugin / `subagents.*` config |
| Release pipeline | `RELEASE_ENABLED` repo variable (no workflow edit) |

The only file a clean fork still edits is the `pyproject` version line.

## 1. Fork the template on GitHub

```bash
gh repo create protoLabsAI/my-agent \
    --template protoLabsAI/protoAgent \
    --public --clone

cd my-agent
```

Or: `Use this template → Create a new repository` from the browser. Pick a short slug (`jon`, `echo-agent`, `product-director`) — it ends up as the image name, metric prefix (`AGENT_NAME`), and Langfuse tag.

## 2. Set your name — don't rename `protoagent`

**Do NOT `sed`-rename `protoagent` across the tree.** The internal `protoagent`
identifier is the logger namespace, the `~/.protoagent` data dir, the `PROTOAGENT_*`
env prefix, and the `protoagent.plugin.yaml` manifest name — renaming it rewrites
~120 files and conflicts on every upstream merge, for zero functional gain. The
**user-facing** name is data, not code:

- `identity.name` in `config/langgraph-config.yaml` (set by the wizard) — drives the console brand, window title, and agent card. A fork sets this once and the whole UI follows.
- `AGENT_NAME` env — the short slug for the Prometheus metric prefix, Langfuse tag, and the `<AGENT_NAME>_API_KEY` auth header.

Leave the internal `protoagent` identifier alone. See [Fork the template](/guides/fork-the-template) for the full no-rename rationale.

## 3. Un-freeze the release pipeline

The release workflows are **opt-in via a repo variable** (so a fork enables them
without editing the workflow files — upstream changes then don't conflict on
re-sync). There is **no `github.repository ==` guard to swap.** Just set the
variable on your fork:

```bash
gh variable set RELEASE_ENABLED --body true   # in your fork's repo
```

`prepare-release.yml` and `release.yml` gate on `if: vars.RELEASE_ENABLED == 'true'`.

## 3b. Stay conformant with the fleet workspace-config standard

Every fleet-watched repo carries a shared baseline enforced by
[`protoLabsAI/release-tools`](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/release-tools)
`verify-workspace-config`, and **`checks.yml` runs it on every PR** — so a
non-conformant fork goes red in CI. The rules that bite most often:

- **Owned runners.** Every workflow `runs-on:` must be
  `namespace-profile-protolabs-linux`, never a GitHub-hosted label
  (`ubuntu-*`, `macos-*`, `windows-*`). Hosted runners burn metered minutes
  and may be disabled org-wide. Legit exceptions (cross-platform binaries,
  npm provenance) get an inline `# workspace-config: allow-hosted-runner <reason>`.
- **`.beads/issues.jsonl` committed**, `.beads/beads.db` gitignored.
- **`.automaker/settings.json` committed**; transient `.automaker/` dirs
  (`features/`, `checkpoints/`, `trajectory/`) gitignored.

A fresh template clone already conforms. If you add or copy a workflow,
keep it on the owned runner. To check (and scaffold) at any time:

```bash
npx --yes -p @protolabsai/release-tools verify-workspace-config
npx --yes -p @protolabsai/release-tools init-workspace-config   # fills gaps
```

The release-notes step in `release.yml` also delegates to the shared
`protoLabsAI/release-tools@v1` Action (reads `GATEWAY_API_KEY` +
`DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK` from CI secrets) rather than a per-fork script —
nothing to copy or maintain.

## 4. Declare the agent card

Your card's advertised **skills** and **description** are your agent's identity — declare them in `langgraph-config.yaml`, **don't edit `server/a2a.py`** (#570):

```yaml
a2a:
  description: "Acme Bot — turns support tickets into triaged, drafted replies."
  skills:
    - id: triage_ticket
      name: Triage Ticket
      description: Classify a support ticket and draft a reply.
      tags: [support]
      examples: ["triage ticket #1234"]
      # Optional structured output — enforced + emitted as a typed DataPart (#476):
      # result_mime: application/vnd.protolabs.triage-v1+json
      # output_schema: { type: object, properties: { ... }, required: [ ... ] }
```

A plugin can contribute card skills too, via `register_a2a_skill(spec)`. The `name` and `url` already pick up `identity.name`, so the wizard-set name lands on the card. Omit the `a2a:` block and the template ships one free-text `chat` placeholder so a fresh clone stays callable.

## 5. (Optional) Add domain tools

See [Starter tools](/reference/starter-tools) for the full default set. To **drop** a core tool, list it in `tools.disabled` (config — no code edit). To **add** tools, ship a [plugin](/guides/plugins) (`register_tools`) — that's the no-fork path that survives upstream merges. Editing `get_all_tools()` in `tools/lg_tools.py` directly still works but is the legacy core-edit that conflicts on re-sync. Any tool the agent ends up with becomes a checkbox in the wizard and drawer automatically.

The memory tools are dropped automatically when `middleware.knowledge: false`; the scheduler tools when `middleware.scheduler: false`. See [Schedule future work](/guides/scheduler) and [Configuration](/reference/configuration#middleware) for the toggles.

## 6. (Optional) Configure subagents

`graph/subagents/config.py` ships with one `researcher`. Register more `SubagentConfig` instances in `SUBAGENT_REGISTRY` and add matching fields in `graph/config.py::LangGraphConfig` — or ship a subagent as a [plugin](/guides/plugins) (`register_subagent`) with no core edit. The lead agent delegates via the `task` tool; the subagent delegation rules are built from the registry.

## 7. Build and ship the image

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/my-org/my-agent:local .

# local test — mount the config volume so wizard completions persist
docker run --rm -p 7870:7870 \
    -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -v my-agent-config:/opt/protoagent/config \
    ghcr.io/my-org/my-agent:local
```

The Dockerfile declares `VOLUME /opt/<agent>/config` so even without `-v` the wizard writes persist across container runs on the same Docker host — they live in an anonymous volume. For production, use a named volume or host mount so you can back it up.

Once the local build is happy, merge a PR to trigger the release pipeline ([Deploy via GHCR](/guides/deploy)).

## 8. Delete `TEMPLATE.md`

Once the checklist is done, `rm TEMPLATE.md` and rewrite `README.md` to describe your specific agent — its purpose, its skills, its operators.

## Canonical reference implementation

[protoLabsAI/roxy](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/roxy) is a fork built on this template, running in production as an autonomous ProtoMaker portfolio manager. When this guide doesn't cover a specific decision, Roxy is the filled-in example — worth a skim before you invent something new.
