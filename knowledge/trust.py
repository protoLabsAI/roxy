"""Trust tiers for knowledge-store rows (ADR 0069 D8).

Every chunk carries a ``source_type`` naming the write path that created it.
This module ranks those write paths into three deterministic trust tiers, so
the delivery layer can down-weight (or, via ``knowledge.inject_min_trust``,
exclude) low-trust content from the per-turn auto-injection while keeping it
reachable on demand through ``memory_recall`` — with the tier visible either
way.

The tiers (higher = more trusted):

- **3 — operator.** The operator wrote it deliberately through a console
  surface (knowledge browser add/edit, memory-inspector hot edit). These rows
  are direct operator intent.
- **2 — agent.** The agent derived it from conversation with the operator:
  extracted facts, harvest summaries, compaction archives, ``memory_ingest``
  notes. Trustworthy in the main, but a model can be induced to write them —
  the MINJA-style poisoning surface.
- **1 — external.** Ingested third-party content: web pages, YouTube
  transcripts, PDFs, transcribed media, pasted documents. The OWASP ASI06
  memory-poisoning surface — nothing here was authored by the operator or
  the agent.

An **unknown or missing** ``source_type`` maps to tier 1: a write path that
doesn't identify itself gets the least trust, not the benefit of the doubt
(this also covers rows written before source stamping existed, and plugin
SDK writes that don't stamp one).

The map is deliberately a code-level constant, not config: the tier of a
write path is a property of the architecture (who can reach that path), not
an operator preference. What IS config is the delivery policy built on it
(``knowledge.inject_min_trust``).
