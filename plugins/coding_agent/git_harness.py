"""Deterministic, framework-owned git lifecycle for managed acp delegates (ADR 0076).

The coder edits files and runs tests; this harness owns everything that touches a
branch, the remote, or the PR — the steps whose LLM ownership caused every observed
reliability failure (never-pushed work, duplicate PRs, branch collisions, committed
scratch). Ported from protoMaker's git workflow (source-verified in
docs/plans/coding-agent-deterministic-git.md), reshaped onto ``tools/shell.run_command``
+ ``tools/gh_cli.run_gh``.

Lifecycle (driven by ``AcpAdapter._dispatch_managed``):

    claim(item_id)                      # in-flight dedup — atomic on the event loop
    preflight_pr(...)                   # open PR already? return it, don't dispatch
    prepare(...)                        # fetch base, branch off origin/<base>, hygiene
    <coder runs, edit-only directive>
    finish(...)                         # guard → scan → commit → rebase → push → PR
    release(item_id)

"Edit-only" is an instruction, not an assumption: ``finish`` is idempotent to the coder
having done partial git itself (committed, or committed *and* pushed) — the three-tier
probe adopts that work instead of failing or duplicating it.
