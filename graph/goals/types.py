"""Goal-mode data types.

A *goal* is a testable outcome the agent self-drives toward: after each turn
the agent "stops" on, a verifier decides whether the goal is met; if not, the
agent is re-invoked with a continuation prompt until it is met, the iteration
budget runs out, or the goal is flagged unachievable.

Unlike protocli's goal system (free-text condition judged by an LLM), the
completion check here is backed by a real verifier (a shell command exit code,
a test run, CI status, or a data assertion) — LLM judgment is only the fallback
verifier type. See ``graph/goals/verifiers.py``.
