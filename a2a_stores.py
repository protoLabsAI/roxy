"""Durable A2A stores + push-callback SSRF guard for the a2a-sdk wiring.

a2a-sdk owns the task lifecycle and push-config persistence, but its
``DefaultRequestHandler`` defaults to the *in-memory* ``InMemoryTaskStore`` /
``InMemoryPushNotificationConfigStore`` — task and push state are lost on a
restart. This module restores the two capabilities the bespoke
``a2a_task_store.py`` / ``a2a_push_store.py`` provided before the SDK migration:

1. **Durable persistence** — SQLite-backed ``DatabaseTaskStore`` /
   ``DatabasePushNotificationConfigStore`` (via SQLAlchemy + aiosqlite), at the
   same on-disk paths the bespoke stores used (instance-scoped per ADR 0004,
   ``/sandbox`` → ``~/.protoagent`` fallback). The SDK DB stores expose no TTL
   knob; the task store carries a ``last_updated`` column, so a 24h TTL sweep is
   reimplemented here (``sweep_expired_tasks``). The push-config model has no
   timestamp column, so push configs persist without the prior 24h TTL.

2. **SSRF guard** — a client supplies the push-notification callback URL; the
   SDK's ``BasePushNotificationSender`` POSTs to it with no validation hook. The
   bespoke store rejected loopback / RFC1918 / link-local / multicast / reserved
   targets (with a hostname + CIDR allowlist for trusted docker-network agents).
   That policy is restored verbatim and applied at BOTH config set-time
   (``ValidatingPushNotificationConfigStore.set_info``) and send-time
   (``ValidatingPushNotificationSender._dispatch_notification``).
