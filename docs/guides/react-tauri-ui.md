# React + Tauri UI Migration

This is the implementation plan for replacing the Gradio UI with a React
operator console, then wrapping it in a Tauri desktop app once the web surface
is stable.

## Source Patterns To Adopt

Use these local references as the starting point:

| Source | Pattern to reuse |
|---|---|
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/projects/ava-chat-system-architecture/` | Architecture notes for multi-session chat, tab systems, client/server contract, and component hierarchy |
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/apps/ui/src/store/chat-store.ts` | Zustand-persisted chat sessions, active-session pool, per-session streaming state |
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/apps/ui/src/components/views/chat-overlay/chat-session-pool.tsx` | Keep multiple chat sessions mounted so background streams continue while hidden |
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/apps/ui/src/components/views/notes-view.tsx` | Multi-tab notes surface with editor toolbar and per-tab agent permissions |
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/apps/server/src/services/beads-service.ts` | `br --json` subprocess boundary; do not read `.beads/beads.db` directly |
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/apps/ui/src/components/views/beads-view/beads-view.tsx` | Beads task list renderer and empty-state init flow |
| `/Users/kj/dev/orbis/web/src/plugins/setup-wizard/SetupWizard.tsx` | First-run onboarding structure and step indicator |
| `/Users/kj/dev/orbis/web/src/plugins/PluginHost.tsx` | Slot-based UI shell that lets major surfaces register cleanly |
| `/Users/kj/dev/protomaker/apps/desktop/src-tauri/` | Tauri v2 tray, global hotkey, hide-on-close desktop wrapper |
| `protoLabsAI/protoContent:docs/reference/visual-identity.md` | protoLabs.studio brand tokens, typography, geometry, and motion rules |
| `protoLabsAI/protoContent:apps/payload/src/app/(frontend)/styles.css` | Deployed marketing CSS variables and dark-first surface treatment |

Important Orbis lesson: Orbis removed Tauri because real-time voice/mic capture
through WKWebView added release risk. protoAgent is text-first, so Tauri is
still reasonable, but add voice later through the browser/PWA path unless the
native media-capture work is explicitly scoped.

## Proto Brand Theme Contract

The React console should use the protoLabs.studio visual identity from
`protoContent` as its source of truth, adapted for dense operator tooling rather
than a marketing page. The useful rule is dark, gray, compact, and precise:
content and work state are the focus; chrome stays quiet.

Brand identity:

- Wordmark text is `protoLabs.studio`: lowercase `p`, capital `L`, dot included.
- Use `protoLabsAI` only for the GitHub organization slug.
- Use `proto-labs.ai` for service hostnames.
- Prefer the outline icon in app navigation and small in-product surfaces. Keep
  neon/large brand treatments for README, splash, install, or about surfaces.

CSS tokens for the first React scaffold:

```css
:root {
  --brand-violet: #7c3aed;
  --brand-violet-light: #a78bfa;
  --brand-indigo: #6366f1;
  --brand-indigo-bright: #818cf8;
  --brand-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #a78bfa 0%, #818cf8 50%, #6366f1 100%);

  --bg: #0a0a0c;
  --bg-raised: #131316;
  --fg: #ededed;
  --fg-muted: #8b8b94;
  --border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  --border-strong: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18);

  --font-sans: "Geist", system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: "Geist Mono", ui-monospace, "SF Mono", monospace;
  --radius: 6px;
}
```

Implementation rules:

- Dark-first UI with 14px base text, Geist Sans, and Geist Mono for code,
  metric tags, IDs, and logs.
- Use a 4px spacing grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48.
- Keep operator rows at 32-36px and panel padding at 12-16px.
- Use 1px low-contrast borders. Do not add decorative shadows to flat content.
- Use gradients only for brand moments, not buttons, panels, rails, or task rows.
- Keep letter spacing at `0` in the app UI; marketing display treatments do not
  carry into dense console components.
- Do not use glass morphism, backdrop blur, emoji decoration, mascots, or
  rounded-full rectangles. Pills are for badges and avatars only.
- Motion is restrained: 150ms hover, 200ms page transition, 400ms theme switch,
  1000ms linear loading, and 2000ms status pulse. Respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Status colors should remain semantic and low-chroma: success, warning, error,
and info backgrounds at roughly 15-20% opacity. They should never be used as
ambient decoration.

## Target Shape

Keep the Python/FastAPI/LangGraph backend as the agent runtime. Replace only
the operator surface first.

```
apps/web/                     React + Vite operator console
  src/app/App.tsx             shell, slots, routing
  src/chat/                   multi-session chat pool
  src/setup/                  first-run setup wizard
  src/notes/                  notes tabs/editor
  src/beads/                  task list renderer over br-backed API
  src/subagents/              manual subagent launcher
  src/lib/api.ts              FastAPI/A2A client

server.py                     FastAPI API + static React asset serving
graph/agent.py                LangGraph lead + subagent runtime
src-tauri/                    Tauri shell after web app works
```

Do not remove Gradio in the first slice. Mount React under `/app` or serve it
when enabled by an env flag, keep `/` Gradio until the React app covers setup,
chat, config, and diagnostics.

Web scaffold commands:

```bash
npm run web:dev
npm run web:build
npm run web:preview
```

The built app lives under `apps/web/dist/`. `server.py` serves it at `/app`
when that directory contains `index.html`; otherwise the server boots without
mounting the React surface.

## Required Backend Contracts

The current backend already has useful pieces:

- `GET /api/config/setup-status`
- `GET/POST /api/config`
- `POST /api/config/setup`
- `POST /api/config/models`
- `POST /api/chat` non-streaming
- A2A `POST /a2a` with `message/send`, `message/stream`, and `tasks/get`
- `GET/DELETE /api/goal/{session_id}`

Add these before the React UI depends on them:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/runtime/status` | setup state, configured model, enabled middleware, knowledge path, scheduler state |
| `GET /api/subagents` | list `SUBAGENT_REGISTRY` entries, tool allowlists, max turns, enabled state |
| `POST /api/subagents/run` | manually launch one subagent with `{session_id, type, description, prompt, emit_skill}` |
| `POST /api/subagents/batch` | manually launch independent subagent jobs concurrently |
| `GET /api/beads/status?project_path=` | detect initialized `.beads/` store through `br list --json` |
| `POST /api/beads/init` | run `br init` idempotently |
| `GET/POST /api/beads/issues` | list/create/update/close/delete issues through `br --json` |
| `GET/POST /api/notes/workspace` | load/save the notes workspace file |
| `GET/POST /api/scheduler/jobs`, `DELETE /api/scheduler/jobs/{id}` | list/create/cancel scheduled jobs over the active `SchedulerBackend` |
| `GET /api/goals`, `DELETE /api/goals/{session_id}` | list goals across sessions / clear one (goals are *set* in chat via `/goal`) |
| `GET /api/chat/commands` | registered slash commands (`{name, description, usage}`) for the composer's `/` autocomplete |
| `GET /api/events` | **server→client SSE push channel** (ADR 0003). Holds open for the app's lifetime; the server pushes unsolicited events (`activity.message`, `inbox.item`) the request-scoped chat stream can't. Read-only. |
| `GET /api/activity` | the durable **Activity thread**'s message history (ADR 0003) — `{context_id, messages:[{role, content}]}` read from the checkpointer (`a2a:system:activity`). Where agent-initiated turns (scheduled fires) land. |
| `POST /api/inbox` | **authenticated inbound intake** (ADR 0003). `{text, priority?, source?, dedup_key?}` — `priority` is `now` \| `next` \| `later`. `now` items fire an Activity turn immediately; the rest queue for the agent's `check_inbox` tool. Bearer token required (same token as `/a2a`). |
| `GET /api/inbox` | console-side list of pending inbox items (`?floor=&include_delivered=`) → `{items:[…]}`. Unauthenticated like other operator reads. |
| `POST /api/inbox/{id}/deliver` | mark one item delivered (the console "dismiss" action). |

### Event stream (push channel)

The console opens one `EventSource` to `GET /api/events` for the app's lifetime
(`lib/events.ts` — `onServerEvent(name, fn)` / `onConnectionChange(fn)`), backed
server-side by an in-process `EventBus` (`events/bus.py`, bounded drop-oldest
queues). The topbar **live dot** reflects the connection. This is the foundation
for the reactive surfaces in ADR 0003 (the Activity thread, the inbox); producers
call `bus.publish(event, data)` from the event loop and every connected console
receives it. Frames are SSE `event:`/`data:` with periodic `: keepalive` comments.

> **Playwright note:** a long-lived SSE connection never lets `networkidle`
> settle — navigate with `waitUntil: "load"` in e2e, not `"networkidle"`.

### Activity surface

The **Activity** rail surface (`activity/ActivitySurface.tsx`) is the console
view of the durable Activity thread (ADR 0003). It loads history from
`GET /api/activity`, appends live as `activity.message` events arrive, and lets
the operator reply — a normal turn into the `system:activity` context. The
operator's own message is appended optimistically; the assistant's reply arrives
via the same `activity.message` event a scheduled fire produces, so there's one
uniform render path and no double-render. A rail **unread badge** counts events
that land while the operator is on another surface.

### Inbound inbox

`POST /api/inbox` is the general inbound channel (ADR 0003) — webhooks, scripts,
and sister agents push stimuli here. It's **authenticated** (an inbound item can
initiate an agent turn, so it carries the same bearer token as `/a2a`). Items
have a priority tier: `now` fires an Activity turn immediately (subject to a
dedup window + an anti-storm rate cap), while `next`/`later` queue for the
agent's **`check_inbox`** tool to surface on its own terms. Items live in a
durable SQLite `inbox` table; a `dedup_key` collapses a retrying producer's
repeats. Arrivals publish an `inbox.item` event on the bus.

The console exposes this as the **Inbox** tab in the right sidebar (alongside
Notes and Beads, `inbox/InboxPanel.tsx`): it lists pending items from
`GET /api/inbox` with their priority + source, live-updates on `inbox.item`,
carries an unread badge while you're on another tab, and dismisses an item
(marks it delivered) via `POST /api/inbox/{id}/deliver`. External intake stays
token-gated on `POST /api/inbox`; the read/dismiss views are console-side.

Manual subagents should reuse the existing `_run_subagent` implementation, but
expose it through a service function instead of calling the lead agent's tool.
Keep the one-level delegation guard: manually launched subagents do not receive
`task` or `task_batch`.

## React UI Surfaces

### 1. Shell

Use the Orbis slot pattern:

- `stage`: main work area
- `left-rail`: navigation
- `right-panel`: notes/beads/details
- `overlay-top`: status and connection banners
- `modal`: setup wizard, command palette

This keeps chat, notes, beads, and setup independent instead of building one
large component tree.

### 2. Setup Wizard

Adapt Orbis's wizard structure to protoAgent:

1. Welcome
2. Identity: agent name, operator name
3. Model gateway: API base, API key, model probe
4. Agent persona: SOUL preset and editable SOUL text
5. Tools: middleware toggles, subagent defaults
6. Workspace: memory/knowledge path, optional beads init
7. Finish: write config, mark setup complete, open first chat

Use the existing `/api/config/*` endpoints. Never persist API keys in the
React store; send them only to the backend setup/config API.

### 3. Multi-Chat

Port the Ava chat store and session-pool model:

- persisted sessions in localStorage
- max 50 saved sessions
- max 5 mounted active sessions
- hidden sessions stay mounted while streaming
- per-session status map for background work indicators
- session-scoped goal status panel using `/api/goal/{session_id}`

For streaming, prefer A2A `message/stream` first because it already emits task
state and tool progress. A later pass can add an AI-SDK-compatible `/api/chat`
stream if we want to use `@ai-sdk/react` directly.

The shipped chat surface already renders assistant markdown
(`apps/web/src/chat/Markdown.tsx`), slash-command autocomplete from
`GET /api/chat/commands`, and **live tool-call cards**: each tool the agent
invokes streams in as a collapsible card (name, running→done/error state,
input/result preview) via the `tool-call-v1` DataPart on `status-update`
frames — see [Extensions § tool-call-v1](/reference/extensions#tool-call-v1)
for the wire contract and `apps/web/src/chat/ToolCalls.tsx` for the renderer.

### 4. Manual Subagents

Add a panel next to chat:

- choose subagent type from `GET /api/subagents`
- write description + prompt
- launch one job or a batch
- stream tool/status events into a compact task timeline
- insert result into the current chat, save to notes, or emit as a skill

This is different from the lead agent autonomously calling `task()`: the user
can fan out work explicitly when they know the decomposition.

### 5. Notes

Port the ProtoMaker Notes model:

- tab bar with inline rename and protected last tab
- editor toolbar
- per-tab permissions: agent can read, agent can write
- debounced save to backend
- selected readable notes get included in chat/subagent request context

Start with Markdown/plain HTML if TipTap is too heavy for the first slice; keep
the store shape compatible with the ProtoMaker `NotesWorkspace`.

### 6. Beads Task List

Build a Python equivalent of `BeadsService`:

- shell out to `br --json`
- run with `cwd=project_path`
- parse structured errors from stdout/stderr
- expose only JSON DTOs to React
- never inspect `.beads/beads.db` directly

The React renderer should start with:

- init empty state
- create issue row
- grouped task table by status
- priority/type/status badges
- close/start/delete actions

Later: dependencies graph, ready queue, comments, and agent-created issue links.

## Tauri Packaging

Only start Tauri after the React web app works in-browser.

Desktop requirements:

- Tauri v2
- tray icon
- global hotkey to show/hide
- hide-on-close
- bundled static React app
- Python sidecar or "connect to existing local server" mode
- OS-standard data dirs mapped to memory/knowledge/config paths

For the first desktop cut, prefer connect-to-local-server mode. Bundling and
supervising the Python sidecar is a separate packaging problem and should not
block React UI validation.

## Migration Slices

1. **API prep**: add runtime/subagent/beads/notes JSON contracts with tests.
2. **React scaffold**: Vite + React + TypeScript under `apps/web`, served at `/app`, with the proto brand theme tokens above.
3. **Setup wizard**: port the Orbis flow using protoAgent config steps.
4. **Chat shell**: port Ava chat store/session pool; use A2A streaming.
5. **Manual subagents**: add launcher and batch runner UI.
6. **Notes + beads**: port notes tabs and build the `br` task renderer.
7. **Tauri shell**: wrap `/app`, add tray/hotkey/hide-on-close.
8. **Gradio retirement**: remove only after React covers setup, config, chat, diagnostics.

## Directory Allowlist

The beads and notes APIs take a `project_path` from the (free-text) UI, so the
server — not the client — decides which directories they may read and write.
`operator.allowed_dirs` in `config/langgraph-config.yaml` is that boundary:

- The protoAgent repo root is always allowed (the default project).
- Add other project roots you operate on to `operator.allowed_dirs`, or edit
  the list in-app from the setup wizard's **Workspace** step.
- An out-of-allowlist path is rejected with a 400 before any subprocess or file
  I/O. `resolve_project_path` resolves symlinks and `..` *before* the
  containment check, so neither can escape an allowed root.
- The runtime-status `project.allowed_dirs` field feeds the project-path
  picker's suggestions; it does not relax the server-side check.

## Studio & Activity surfaces (the control stack)

Per [ADR 0009](/adr/0009-studio-control-stack), the Studio tabs are ordered by
altitude — **Goals** (autonomy: when to stop) → **Workflows** (orchestration: the
order) → **Run** (execution: one focused worker, with the Single/Batch toggle).
They're layers of one control loop, not peers. **Schedule** moved to **Activity**
(Thread · Inbox · Schedule) — cron is a *trigger* ("when"), grouped with the
inbox/event-bus (ADR 0003), not a Studio work-type. Skills moved to the
**Knowledge ▸ Playbooks** surface (below) — they're retrieved memory, not work.

## Telemetry surface

The **System ▸ Telemetry** sub-tab (`apps/web/src/telemetry/TelemetrySurface.tsx`,
ADR 0006) renders the local per-turn cost/latency rollup: summary cards (total
cost, turns, success rate, cache-hit %, p50/p95 latency, tokens, tool calls), a
by-model table, and a recent-turns table. It reads `GET /api/telemetry/summary`
+ `/api/telemetry/recent` — no chat-stream coupling — and degrades to a clear
note when the store is disabled or empty.

## Playbooks surface

The **Knowledge ▸ Playbooks** surface (`apps/web/src/playbooks/PlaybooksSurface.tsx`,
ADR 0009) browses the procedural-memory skill index (`skills.db`) the operator
was otherwise blind to. It lists each skill as **pinned** (a `SKILL.md` on disk,
re-seeded at boot) or **learned** (agent-emitted, curated/decaying), with
confidence + last-used, a search filter, and delete-with-confirm. Reads
`GET /api/playbooks`; deletes via `DELETE /api/playbooks/{id}`. "Playbooks" is
the operator-facing name for skill-v1 artifacts — see ADR 0009 (it disambiguates
from the A2A agent-card `skills` field). Confidence-tuning + curator-audit
read-back are noted follow-ups.

## Settings surface

The **Settings** rail surface lets an operator manage every config field from
the UI. It's **schema-driven**: `GET /api/settings/schema` returns the fields
grouped by section with their type, current value, default, description, and a
`restart` flag; the React surface (`apps/web/src/settings/SettingsSurface.tsx`)
renders the inputs generically, so new config fields appear automatically
without a UI change. Saving POSTs only the changed fields to `POST
/api/settings`, which validates, writes the YAML (secrets split into
`secrets.yaml`), and **hot-reloads the agent** in-process — most changes apply
without a restart. The rare fields that need a process restart carry a `restart`
badge and raise a banner when edited. Secrets are never echoed back (shown as
`(set)` / `unset`). The field registry lives in `graph/settings_schema.py`.

## E2E smoke harness

The console has a Playwright smoke suite under `apps/web/e2e/` that drives the
**built** SPA against a deterministic mock backend — no Python, langgraph,
model, or network. It exists so the rendering contract (the part most likely to
regress) is verifiable in CI.

- `apps/web/e2e/mock-server.mjs` serves the built `dist/` *and* the subset of
  the operator API + the `/a2a` SSE stream the console calls, with canned data
  from `apps/web/e2e/fixtures.mjs`. The A2A scenario is chosen from the prompt
  text (`MARKDOWN`, `OVERFLOW`, default) so specs can drive different paths.
- Specs: `chat.spec.ts` (tool-call cards — collapsed-by-default, pretty-printed
  JSON on expand, markdown answers, no horizontal overflow), `commands.spec.ts`
  (slash-command autocomplete), `navigation.spec.ts` (every surface mounts; the
  Runtime panel shows skills / MCP / plugins).
- Run locally: `npm run test:e2e --workspace @protoagent/web` (builds first,
  boots the mock server, runs headless). `test:e2e:ui` opens the Playwright UI.
- CI: the **Web E2E smoke** job in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`.

When you add a console feature, extend the mock fixtures + a spec rather than
reaching for a live backend — keep the harness deterministic.

## Risks

- A2A streaming events are not AI SDK data-stream events; the first chat UI
  should consume A2A directly instead of forcing `useChat`.
- Long-running hidden chat sessions need explicit caps and stop controls.
- Manual subagent launch must inherit audit/tracing/session IDs or debugging
  becomes harder than autonomous `task()` calls.
- Tauri packaging can consume a lot of time. Keep it behind the working web UI.
- Do not copy Orbis voice/Tauri assumptions into this app; protoAgent is a
  text-first agent console.
