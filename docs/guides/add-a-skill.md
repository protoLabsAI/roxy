# Add a custom skill

A *skill* is a named capability A2A callers can dispatch to. Skills live on the agent card, not in your Python code. Adding one does not create a new handler — it advertises an existing capability so callers can target it.

## When you need a skill

- You want another agent (via A2A) to invoke a specific mode of behaviour — e.g. `pr_review` vs. `bug_triage`.
- You want Workstacean's planner to rank your agent against a specific goal.
- You want per-skill cost telemetry (cost-v1 samples are keyed by `(agent, skill)`).

You don't need a skill for "things the chat UI does" — the Gradio chat is already covered by the default dispatch path.

## 1. Add to the card

Edit the `_SKILL_SPECS` list in `server.py` (the card builder `_build_agent_card_proto` turns it into the card's `skills` via `_agent_skills()`). Each spec is a dict — this is where entries go:

```python
"skills": [
    {
        "id": "chat",
        "name": "Chat",
        "description": "General-purpose chat interface.",
        "tags": ["template"],
        "examples": ["hello", "what can you do?"],
    },
    # ↓ new skill
    {
        "id": "summarize_pr",
        "name": "Summarize Pull Request",
        "description": "Fetch a GitHub PR and return a three-bullet summary of what it changes and why.",
        "tags": ["github", "summarization"],
        "examples": [
            "summarize https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoAgent/pull/64",
        ],
    },
],
```

**IDs are sticky**. `cost-v1` samples, `effect-domain-v1` declarations, and Workstacean's routing all key off the `id`. Pick one and don't rename later.

## 2. (Optional) Declare an effect

If the skill actually mutates shared state Workstacean cares about (creates a PR, files an issue, updates a board), declare it under `effect-domain-v1`:

```python
"capabilities": {
    "streaming": True,
    "pushNotifications": True,
    "extensions": [
        {"uri": "https://proto-labs.ai/a2a/ext/cost-v1"},
        {
            "uri": "https://proto-labs.ai/a2a/ext/effect-domain-v1",
            "params": {
                "skills": {
                    "file_bug": {
                        "effects": [{
                            "domain": "protomaker_board",
                            "path": "data.backlog_count",
                            "delta": 1,
                            "confidence": 0.9,
                        }],
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    ],
},
```

Only declare effects for skills that actually mutate shared state. Over-declaring confuses the L1 planner into routing your agent for goals it can't move.

## 3. Teach the LLM about the skill

Skill dispatch doesn't add code paths — the A2A handler just forwards the caller's message to the same LangGraph runtime that handles chat. What makes a skill *do something* is that the system prompt teaches the LLM how to behave when it sees a request matching the skill's intent.

Add the skill's behaviour description to your persona file, **`config/SOUL.md`** (the wizard writes it; `graph/prompts.py::build_system_prompt` reads it into the system prompt — you don't edit `prompts.py`):

```markdown
You handle general chat plus these skills:

- **summarize_pr** — when the user sends a GitHub PR URL, fetch the PR
  with `github_get_pr`, then return a three-bullet summary: what changed,
  why, and any risks. Keep each bullet under two sentences.
```

The LLM routes by reading the user's message. Skill IDs on the card exist for callers; skill *behaviour* lives in `SOUL.md`.

## 4. Verify on the card

```bash
curl http://localhost:7870/.well-known/agent-card.json | jq '.skills[] | .id'
# "chat"
# "summarize_pr"
```

And hit it via A2A:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7870/a2a \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "1",
      "method": "message/send",
      "params": {
        "message": {
          "role": "user",
          "parts": [{"text": "summarize https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoAgent/pull/64"}]
        },
        "metadata": {"skill": "summarize_pr"}
      }
    }'
```

## 5. Test it

Add to `tests/test_a2a_integration.py`:

```python
def test_agent_card_includes_summarize_pr_skill():
    from server import _SKILL_SPECS
    skill_ids = {s["id"] for s in _SKILL_SPECS}
    assert "summarize_pr" in skill_ids
```
