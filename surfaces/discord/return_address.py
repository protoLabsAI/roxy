"""Discord return-address store (ADR 0015).

When the operator DMs the agent, the gateway records that **DM channel id** here.
Scheduler-fired and proactive turns have no originating caller — they need a
stored "where do I deliver?" address. With one captured, reactive Activity-thread
output (ADR 0003) is forwarded to the operator's Discord DM, so "remind me in 30
minutes" actually lands somewhere.

Single small JSON file, instance-scoped via ``paths.scope_leaf`` (ADR 0004),
mirroring the bespoke stores' ``/sandbox`` → ``~/.protoagent`` fallback. Override
the location with ``DISCORD_RETURN_ADDRESS_PATH`` (used by tests).
