# Operator REST API

The console drives the backend over a REST control-plane under `/api/*` (defined in
`operator_api/`). This is the **operator** surface — managing one agent and its host.
For talking *to* the agent as a client, use the [A2A endpoints](/reference/a2a-endpoints)
(`/a2a`) or the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` surface instead.

All `/api/*` routes are gated by the same bearer auth as the rest of the server (set via
`A2A_AUTH_TOKEN` / the configured token); the console attaches it automatically. This page
is a map — `operator_api/*.py` is the source of truth for exact request/response shapes.
