"""Model Context Protocol (MCP) client — expose MCP-server tools to the agent.

Configured MCP servers (stdio or streamable-HTTP) are connected via
``langchain-mcp-adapters``; their tools are discovered at graph-build time and
appended to the agent's tool list as ordinary LangChain ``BaseTool``s. Tools are
namespaced by server (``<server>__<tool>``) so they can't shadow core tools, and
``MultiServerMCPClient`` is stateless — each invocation opens a fresh MCP
session — so the discovered tools are event-loop-agnostic and the client object
just needs to stay alive for reconnection.

Configuring a server is the opt-in act; MCP is off unless ``mcp.enabled`` is set.
