"""Real-subprocess fleet CRASH -> DETECT -> RESTART coverage.

Boots a hub, has it spawn a real member, hard-kills the member with SIGKILL
(no graceful shutdown), then asserts the hub detects it down PASSIVELY (a plain
``/api/fleet`` poll reports it not-running) and restarts it to a fresh, healthy
process with a NEW pid and its data dir intact.

This is the failure mode the harness had no coverage for: every prior fleet test
only exercised the happy spawn/proxy path, never a member dying underneath the hub.

A SIGKILLed member is the hub's child and lingers as a zombie until reaped, and
``os.kill(pid, 0)`` reports a zombie as alive — which used to mask the crash from
``status()`` and make ``supervisor.start`` no-op on the dead pid. ``_alive`` now
reaps the zombie (targeted ``waitpid``) before probing, so passive detection works
and a restart spawns a genuinely new process — no operator ``stop`` reconcile
needed. (See ``graph/fleet/supervisor._reap``.)
